## 4.14.0

<small id="4.14.0">Release date: 2016-06-14</small>

Express 4.14.0 is a bunch of bug fixes, performance improvements, and minor feature additions. The most relevant changes are described below.

`res.sendFile` now accepts two new options, `acceptRanges` and `cacheControl`.

You can use `acceptRanges`, which defauts to `true`, to enable or disable accepting ranged requests. Disabling it will not send `Accept-Ranges` and ignore the contents of the `Range` request header.

`cacheControl`, which defaults to `true`, can be used to enable or disable setting `Cache-Control` response header. Disabling it will ignore the `maxAge` option.

`res.sendFile` has also been updated to handle `Range` header and redirections better.

`res.location` and `res.redirect` will now handle non-ascii characters better.
